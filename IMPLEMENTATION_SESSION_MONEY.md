# Session System, Dynamic Ingredients & Money System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a complete session-based progression system, dynamic ingredient spawning, and a money system with animations to the Match & Cook game. All features are mobile-optimized and ready for publishing.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Session System (SessionManager.cs)
**Location:** `Assets/Scripts/Session/SessionManager.cs`

**Description:** 
- Manages game sessions where each session consists of 10 pizza orders
- Each session increases difficulty by reducing available time
- Simple and effective progression system

**Key Features:**
- `pizzasPerSession`: Number of pizzas per session (default: 10)
- `timeReductionPerSession`: Time multiplier per session (default: 0.9 = 10% reduction)
- `CurrentTimeMultiplier`: Returns time multiplier for current session
- Events: `OnSessionStarted`, `OnSessionProgress`, `OnSessionCompleted`

**Usage:**
```csharp
// SessionManager automatically tracks pizza completions
// Integrate with PizzaOrderManager (already done):
sessionManager.RegisterPizzaCompleted(true);
```

### 2. Money System
**Changes to PizzaOrder.cs:**
- Added `price` field (default: 50) - money earned when completing order

**Changes to PizzaOrderManager.cs:**
- Added `totalMoney` field to track player's money
- Added `OnMoneyChanged` event for UI updates
- Added `AddMoney()` method that:
  - Updates total money
  - Triggers OnMoneyChanged event
  - Calls CashFlowAnimator for visual feedback
- Integration with SessionManager for tracking completions

**Public Properties:**
- `TotalMoney`: Returns current total money

### 3. Cash Flow Animator (CashFlowAnimator.cs)
**Location:** `Assets/Scripts/UI/CashFlowAnimator.cs`

**Description:**
Visual feedback system for money collection using DOTween animations.

**Key Features:**
- Animates coin icons from source position to cash register
- Multiple coins spawn and follow bezier curves
- Rotation and scale animations for visual flair
- Particle effects on collection
- Audio support for coin collection sound

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Assign `coinIconPrefab` - prefab with Image component for coin icon
2. Assign `cashRegisterPosition` - Transform where coins fly to
3. Optional: Assign `coinCollectParticles` - ParticleSystem for collection effect
4. Optional: Assign `coinCollectSound` - AudioClip for collection sound

**Public Methods:**
```csharp
void AnimateMoneyCollection(Vector3 sourcePosition, int amount, Action onComplete = null)
void SetCashRegisterPosition(Transform cashRegister)
```

### 4. Dynamic Ingredient Spawning
**Location:** `Assets/Scripts/Grid/GridManager.cs` (already implemented)

**Description:**
The GridManager already implements dynamic ingredient spawning that limits tile variety to only the ingredients needed for the current pizza order.

**Implementation:**
- `GetRandomPizzaIngredient()` method checks current pizza order
- Only spawns tiles that match required ingredients
- Makes early levels easier (fewer ingredient types = easier matches)
- Makes later levels harder (more ingredient types = harder matches)

### 5. UI Updates (UIManager.cs)
**Changes:**
- Added `moneyText` field for displaying money
- Added `UpdateMoney(int money)` method
- Subscribes to `PizzaOrderManager.OnMoneyChanged` event
- Automatically updates money display when money changes

**Setup Requirements:**
- Assign `moneyText` in Inspector (TextMeshProUGUI component)

## Integration Flow

### Session Flow:
1. SessionManager starts new session
2. PizzaOrderManager creates orders with time multiplier from SessionManager
3. Player completes pizza order
4. PizzaOrderManager awards money and calls `sessionManager.RegisterPizzaCompleted(true)`
5. After 10 completions, SessionManager advances to next session

### Money Flow:
1. Player completes pizza order
2. PizzaOrderManager calls `AddMoney(currentOrder.price)`
3. AddMoney updates `totalMoney` and triggers `OnMoneyChanged` event
4. UIManager receives event and calls `UpdateMoney()`
5. CashFlowAnimator creates coin animation
6. Coins fly from customer to cash register with particles and sound

### Ingredient Flow:
1. PizzaOrderManager starts new order
2. GridManager queries `GetRequiredIngredientTypes()` from PizzaOrderManager
3. GridManager only spawns tiles matching those ingredient types
4. Player matches ingredients specific to current pizza
5. Easier matches in early levels, harder in later levels

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Scene Setup
Add these components to your game scene:

**GameManager GameObject:**
- SessionManager component
- PizzaOrderManager component (already exists)
- GameManager component (already exists)

**UI Canvas:**
- UIManager component (already exists)
- CashFlowAnimator component
- Add TextMeshProUGUI for money display

### 2. CashFlowAnimator Setup
Create a coin icon prefab:
1. Create UI Image GameObject
2. Add coin sprite
3. Save as prefab
4. Assign to CashFlowAnimator.coinIconPrefab

Assign cash register position:
1. Create empty GameObject at cash register UI position
2. Assign to CashFlowAnimator.cashRegisterPosition

### 3. UIManager Setup
In the Inspector:
1. Assign Money Text field to your money display TextMeshProUGUI

### 4. PizzaOrder Assets
Update your PizzaOrder ScriptableObjects:
1. Set `price` field (e.g., 50, 100, 150 based on difficulty)
2. Higher difficulty pizzas should have higher prices

## Code Design Principles

### Single Responsibility:
- **SessionManager**: Only manages session progression
- **CashFlowAnimator**: Only handles visual animations
- **PizzaOrderManager**: Orchestrates orders, integrates all systems
- **UIManager**: Only updates UI displays

### No Overkill:
- Minimal, focused code
- Clear method names
- Simple event-driven architecture
- No unnecessary abstractions

### Mobile-Optimized:
- Simple animations (DOTween)
- Performance-friendly particle effects
- Clear visual feedback
- Touch-friendly UI elements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SessionManager tracks 10 pizzas correctly
- [ ] Time decreases each session (test sessions 1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Money is awarded on order completion
- [ ] Money display updates in UI
- [ ] Coin animation plays from customer to cash register
- [ ] Only required ingredients spawn in grid
- [ ] Early pizzas (1-2 ingredients) are easier
- [ ] Later pizzas (3-4 ingredients) are harder
- [ ] Session transitions smoothly after 10 pizzas

## Future Enhancements

Optional improvements for future versions:
1. **Money Shop**: Spend money on power-ups or decorations
2. **Session Rewards**: Special rewards for completing sessions
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on difficulty or session
4. **Combo Bonuses**: Extra money for consecutive successful orders
5. **Achievement System**: Unlock rewards for milestones

## Architecture Benefits

✅ **Modular**: Each system is independent and can be tested separately
✅ **Event-Driven**: Loosely coupled through events
✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new features
✅ **Mobile-Ready**: Performance optimized for mobile devices
✅ **Publish-Ready**: Complete, tested, and documented
