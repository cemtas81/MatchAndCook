# Placeholder Tile Sprites

This folder contains placeholder sprites for match-3 tiles.
These are simple colored squares that can be easily replaced with final artwork.

Tile Types:
- Red Tile (for cooking ingredients like tomatoes)
- Blue Tile (for water/ice ingredients)  
- Green Tile (for vegetables/herbs)
- Yellow Tile (for grains/pasta)
- Purple Tile (for special ingredients)

Each sprite should be 64x64 pixels for optimal mobile performance.
